#Code Snippets Library Built in React

The Code Snippets Library stores code snippets for future use. I built this app because I was tired of typing the same lines of code again and again. This app allows me to be efficient and save time when creating a project.

Snippets are organised into categories. Users can add new snippets and delete snippets. Users can also add and delete categories.

This App was built in React.
